___

Replicated visualizations from my time at Thomson Reuters. Original plot can be found at: <http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130425/srep01684/full/srep01684.html>

### Plots and Descriptions
<center>![Figure 1-1](./first_plot.png)
<center> **Figure 1**
<center> This plot shows relative change in U.S. Google Trend search volume for 'debt' over a three-week period and the corresponding Dow Jones Industrial Average. The extreme values are removed to make the changes in debt search volume more clear.  


<center>![Figure 1-1](./second_plot.png)
<center> **Figure 2**
<center> This plot is the same as Figure 1, but contains the extreme values. 


<center>![Figure 1-1](./third_plot.png)
<center> **Figure 3**
<center> Rather than use a three week time window like the above plots, we toggled the window to two weeks. 

<center>![Figure 1-1](./fourth_plot.png)
<center> **Figure 4**
<center> Again, a change in time window -- this time to one week. 

<center>![Figure 1-1](./fifth_plot.png)
<center> **Figure 5**
<center> This plot shows the relative change at a daily level. There is a clear weekly pattern in the relative changes in search volume.
